# NASA-SPACE-APPS-Robin-8263

ABOUT THE TEAM
Meet the Robotics Team of Saint Benoît French High School! Robin#8263 is a robotics team composed of dedicated individuals. One of the distinct characteristics of our team is having a strong team spirit where each member focuses on supporting, motivating, and working together to achieve success. This team spirit encourages a willingness to collaborate when faced with challenges and ensures the successful completion of projects. We are prepared and eager to participate in the Space Apps 2023 challenge!


ABOUT THE CHALLENGE
Since its July 14, 2022 launch to the space station, the EMIT hyperspectral visible/short-wave infrared sensor has been extremely useful! It is identifying the composition of Earth’s surface and how mineral dust influences global warming. It’s helping to detect methane and carbon dioxide point source emissions to directly address greenhouse gas sources of climate change. EMIT has the potential to revolutionize this field of remote sensing, but if you haven't heard about this sensor, you're not alone! Your challenge is to develop an app that can help raise community awareness of what EMIT is, how it can be used, and what has already been accomplished with its data.

We are a team of 2 students who participated in the 2023 NASA Space Apps Challenge:
